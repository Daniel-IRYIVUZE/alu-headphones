# Web Page Implementation from Scratch - Alu Headphones Project

## Project Overview

In this project, **Daniel Iryivuze** implemented a fully functional web page from scratch, replicating the design provided by **Nicolas Philippot**, a UI/UX designer. I have applied my knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, **accessibility**, and **responsive design** to meet the specifications without relying on any external libraries or JavaScript. The goal was to deliver a web page that accurately mirrors the designer’s file while maintaining high standards of accessibility and responsiveness.

## Requirements Met

- **No External Libraries**: I have not used any external CSS frameworks (such as Bootstrap) in this project.
- **No JavaScript**: The entire project was built using just **HTML** and **CSS**, with no JavaScript involved.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility**: The page follows accessibility best practices to ensure it is user-friendly for everyone.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The design has been tested and optimized to work across modern browsers.
  
## Tasks Completed

### 1. **Header / Hero Section**
   - Implemented the header and hero section using semantic HTML and CSS, ensuring the layout was both responsive and visually aligned with the design provided in Figma.

### 2. **What We Do Section**
   - Created a custom "What We Do" section with CSS-based icons, following the guidelines for reusability in future sections. 

### 3. **Our Results Section**
   - Reused components from previous sections to efficiently implement the "Our Results" section.

### 4. **Contact Us Section**
   - Designed and implemented a clean and functional contact form, with the option to add custom animations and field constraints for enhanced user experience.

### 5. **Footer Section**
   - Completed the footer section, ensuring all necessary elements were in place and consistent with the overall design.

### 6. **Background Image Replacement**
   - For the advanced challenge, I replaced the background image in the "Our Results" section with pure HTML and CSS code, replicating the design of pentagons.

### 7. **Adding Animations**
   - Enhanced the user experience by adding animations to the “What We Do” and “Our Results” sections, incorporating various effects like scaling, opacity, rotation, and hover effects.

### 8. **SASS Conversion**
   - Converted the CSS into SASS for better scalability and maintainability. The final `.scss` file was compiled to ensure it matches the CSS functionality.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: Main HTML structure for each section.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styling for the web page.
- **images/**: Contains images, icons, and other media resources used in the design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the web page.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout, with responsiveness implemented using media queries.
- **SASS** for advanced styling and improved maintainability.
- **Figma** for design reference and asset management.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Design Precision**: Replicating the design from Figma with pixel-perfect accuracy was a challenge, particularly ensuring elements like spacing, font sizes, and alignments matched perfectly.
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the page seamlessly adjusted to different screen sizes, particularly mobile views, required meticulous attention to detail.
3. **Accessibility**: Maintaining a balance between design and accessibility, ensuring that the web page was both visually appealing and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
4. **Advanced Tasks**: The challenges of replacing an image with CSS shapes and adding animations made the project both interesting and rewarding, pushing my CSS skills further.

## Conclusion

I have successfully completed the Alu Headphones web page project by implementing a fully functional, responsive web page from scratch, following the design instructions and meeting all required specifications. By relying on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **responsive design** principles, I have ensured the web page is visually consistent with the provided design and works well across various devices and screen sizes. 

This project has strengthened my skills in web development, particularly in the areas of clean code, accessibility, and responsive design.
